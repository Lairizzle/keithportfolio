I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Arch happily, but I did switch between KDE Plasma and Gnome. I wanted to at least test out a few DE\u0026rsquo;s and see which had the most appeal. One night while watching youtube I came across a video of ThePrimeagen absolutely blasting through his code using NeoVim. I was flabbergasted at how quickly and efficiently he was able to navigate his editor. I\u0026rsquo;d previously had the misfortune of using Vim once or twice and having no idea how to edit anything or even close it and I usually found myself defaulting to nano if I had no option outside of the CLI. I decided this time I would be more deliberate in my approach and put in a true effort to use and learn Vim. Spoiler alert: It. Is. Amazing.\nEnlightenment # The first time I used Vim I asked myself why anyone would ever use it and wrote it off as the worst most masochistic thing I\u0026rsquo;d ever encountered. The truth is that I was just ignorant. After about two days, it started to click. I was memorizing most of the basic motions and I started to feel the flow. It was weak and I was still pretty slow, but there was small tastes of it and it was addictive. One day after a NeoVim session I actually finished up and said to myself, \u0026ldquo;I get it.\u0026rdquo;. There is a weird zen that accompanies the use of NeoVim. Maybe this is why they added a \u0026ldquo;focus\u0026rdquo; mode into Microsoft Word? lol\nGetting Distracted # After getting over the initial discomfort and hurdles of learning some of the motions, the allure of customization hit me. I started looking into all of the awesome NeoVim setups and realized what I needed to do. Not only did NeoVim enlighten me in regards to its superiority as an editor, but it also opened my eyes to the idea of navigating my computer more efficiently. Enter: hyprland. I thought to myself, if I was willing to take the time and learn NeoVim, I could do the same with Hyprland. A window manager seemed like a more natural pairing to use with NeoVim as opposed to a traditional DE and I was right. Now, not only did NeoVim feel like Vim, so did my entire desktop experience.\nCustomization Paralyzation # If you\u0026rsquo;re a Linux user, you\u0026rsquo;ve been there. Lost in the sauce of customization and all the shiny things. I was up to my eyeballs in it. After spending a few days getting used to Hyprland and customizing everything to my hearts content, I switched my focus to NeoVim. It started with some basic NeoVim configs, copying githubs, making stuff from scratch and ultimately ended with NvChad. NvChad served as a great kick off point and has been fantastic.\nMore Pain # After everything was set up, I realized one thing. I wanted to learn Fullstack Javascript and React, but I have no idea how to set up NeoVim as an IDE. After several days of watching youtube videos and getting a crash course on Lua, I finally had a NeoVim setup conducive to starting to learn Javascript and React. I had all the basics going; LSP, Linting, Formatting, DAP, etc. All the tools needed to start writing code were ready and I knew how to use most, except the Debugging, I know its working but I have no idea at all how to use it yet and it might be the most terrifying.\nSeeing The Light # Each day I continue to use NeoVim I can feel myself getting quicker, memorizing more motions and keybinds, discovering new tricks and slowly becoming more efficient. It also feels really great to stay more rooted in terminal when working and it just feels more fun at the end of the day. It has been a mildly frustrating road, but the benefits definitely make the pain worth it. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it, or you just assume its terrible. Do yourself a favour and Vim into something today.\n","date":"29 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/nvim-learning-01/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Learning NeoVim","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/programming/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Programming","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vim/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vim","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"16 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/hello/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hello","type":"tags"},{"content":" Hello World # This is my personal site which will catalogue my work and serve as a portfolio.\nCheers, Keith\n","date":"16 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/hello-world/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Hello World","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"15 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/gaming/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Gaming","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Music","type":"tags"},{"content":" \u0026#x1f937;\u0026zwj;\u0026#x2642;\u0026#xfe0f; Who am I? # Hi! My name is Keith. I am a Dad and a tech enthusiast who was raised by the internet. I am a Linux and FOSS (free and open source software) proponent who works professionally with things like SQL server, Datameer, Tableau, Python and much more. I like to think that I am fairly creative, whether that be with art and music or programming and game development. Learning has always been a top priority for me and expanding my knowledge and skill sets is something I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved doing.\n\u0026#x1f468;\u0026zwj;\u0026#x1f4bc; Work # In my professional work, I focus on generating value from data by creating insights and reporting by leveraging tools like Tableau, Datameer, SQL, and Python. A typical project will start with requirements gathering and stakeholder collaboration. From there data gathering begins and transformation is applied to create scale-able and easily pivot-able datasets. Once the data has been prepared, visualizations are created using Tableau. Visualizations can help stakeholders quickly grasp trends and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. Depending on the type of request, different methods can be employed but simplification, pipeline automation and end-user autonomy is always top of mind.\nðŸ’¾ Computing \u0026amp; Technology # Computing and technology have been a part of my life since I was very young. I have my Poppy (grandfather) and his 133 Mhz machine, 28.8k modem and Netscape Navigator to thank for immersing me in computers at an early age. I will always remember the first time I typed a vulgar and childish instruction into the old Sierra DOS text prompt adventure game called Police Quest and it responded with something funny, I was blown away and I was hooked.\nðŸ‘¾ Game Development # Creating video games in my spare time has been a fantastic journey, and actually publishing a game on Steam was a dream come true. As a hobbyist, experimenting with different game mechanics and art styles over many years has taught me a lot about a plethora of different software, not just game engines like Unity. This pursuit also enabled me to gain a great foundational understanding of C# as a language. I was able to successfully publish a game on Steam, which was a great experience. Even though it is a very simple clicker game, it was a great opportunity to peek behind the curtain and see what is required to formally launch a game on a platform like steam. The game is called PopIt! and you can check it out below. I am currently working on a new game, which is more of an arcade/action style space shooter.\nBuy PopIt! on Steam: ðŸŽ¶ Music # With over 20 years of playing multiple instruments and immersing myself in music, Iâ€™ve had the incredible experience of writing, recording, mixing, mastering and publishing eight full-length albums on Spotify. My musical journey began in dirty basement playing punk songs with friends and it quickly evolved into a lifelong passion. Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of playing and writing with many talented artists over the years but writing with my good friend Douglas Richard Sinclair was always a great experience. I have included links to some of his work below. Working on all of the albums on Spotify allowed me to learn a ton about audio engineering. Over many years I have become quite proficient with different DAWs and have a gained a great understanding of how to make decent sounding recordings.\nMy Personal Spotify Douglas Richard Sinclair's Spotify and Website Check out Doug\u0026rsquo;s Website here!\n\u0026#x1f468;\u0026zwj;\u0026#x1f393; Education \u0026amp; Expertise # Below I have listed a summary of my education, work, personal skills and expertise.
