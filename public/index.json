I have been able to leverage the project management tools in Github to great effect. It really helps keep my ADHD brain on track and keeps me focused on specific tasks instead of getting distracted by the next shiny object, although this still does happen from time to time.\nI have been focused on getting the main systems and mechanics completed so that there is a somewhat functional game loop which can be tested and played with. So far I have been able to complete the following systems/mechanics:\nPlayer movement Enemy base class Basic Enemy Running Enemy Observing Enemy Portal Enemy Turret Enemy Player Powerups (Basic shot, multishot, heat seeking, shield, laser and mines.) Enemy Spawn Manager System Power Up Spawn Manager System Basic Points and Power Up timer tracking on the UI Player Death Replay Button Though a lot of these systems may seem simple, it allows me to create a typical arcade game loop which I expect will be somewhat close to the final product that I scoped for.\nMany of these systems I had written in pieces, and improved upon by refactoring and attempting to reduce redundancies as much as possible. Could it be better? Most likely, but learning to min/max those efficiencies will come in time.\nNext up on the chopping block will probably enemy health.\nCheers, Keith\n","date":"16 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/prototype/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Prototype","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"16 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" About DRU Games # Hi.\n","date":"15 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"DRU Games","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"In my quest to learn more about game development and C#, I recently started work on another game. PopIt! was a simple game which was great to use as a way to understand the process of getting a game ready for launch on Steam. Now that I am armed with the knowledge of how to do that, I can focus more on developing some more cool games.\nWhat is this new game i plan to make? # I think for now I will keep the scope small and realistic. Since I want to build up more foundational knowledge in regards to Unity and C#, I thought I would initially stick with some Arcadey type games that can be realistically executed. I want to actually produce some sort of end result and build a bit of a portfolio (even if it is simple games) as a way to stay motivated and avoid languishing in some sort of protyping/idea/scope creeping hellscape.\nI started working on the new game about a week or so ago now and I am going with a working title of “Prototype”. It will be a space shoot ’em up that take takes place in an arena and will be reminiscent of something like Geometry Wars.\nWhat is done so far? # I wanted to try and approach things in a more methodical way, so I will purposely take things a bit slower and be more deliberate. I leveraged the project management systems available on Github (kind of like a Kan ban) to help plan things out. I currently have separated the tabs into Systems/Mechanics and Content. I figure I will flesh out all of the system and mechanics required to design the game and once that is done I will focus on content like art, effects, sound, music, etc.\nMost of the core mechanics seem to be basically complete so I am making great progress. Now that they are complete, I can refactor them.\nWhat needs to be refactored? # Basically everything will see a refactor pass, as this is not only a best practice but also will be great for building my knowledge base. I recently refactored all the enemy AI scripts and leveraged inheritance for the first time which was super cool to do. I created a base enemy class (this contains all common elements that every enemy will have) and then I can create a script for each enemy type and inherit this and put any custom code needed in the new specific enemy script. This made it really easy to iterate with new enemy types.\nSo far this project seems to be chugging along, as always I will be streaming my progress on twitch and using this blog to document and comment on my personal development.\nCheers, Keith\n","date":"15 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/development-begins/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Development Begins","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"15 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/game-dev/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Game Dev","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"15 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/learning/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Learning","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/unity/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Unity","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"14 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/popit/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Popit","type":"tags"},{"content":" PopIt! has launched on Steam! # I have put in motion everything that is needed to get PopIt! onto the Steam platform. It was a little more complicated than I originally anticipated, but now that I have done it once it should be easier in the future.\nI have recently switched to a complete Linux setup and I still need to look at the best way to update the depots on Steamworks. It looks like the easiest option exists as a executable GUI but I doubt this will run on Linux. There is an alternative that is something to do with SteamCMD but I still need to look into it.\nSteam seems to hold people’s first releases for a little while but hopefully we can get PopIt! released on Steam for early September.\nI want to continue to hone my C# and game development skills, so I will likely use this blog as a way to catalog my development and productivity.\nCheers, Keith\n","date":"14 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/popit-on-steam/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"PopIt! on Steam","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/steam/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Steam","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
