My name is Keith. I am a Dad and a tech enthusiast who was raised by the internet. I am a Linux and FOSS proponent who works professionally with things like sql server, datameer, tableau, python and much more. I like to be creative, whether that be with art and music or programming, game development and engineering. Learning has always been a top priority for me and expanding my knowledge is something I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved.\n\u0026#x1f468;\u0026zwj;\u0026#x1f4bc; Work # In my professional work, I focus on generating value from data insights and creating reporting by leveraging tools like Tableau, Datameer, SQL, and Python. A typical project will start with requirements gathering and stakeholder collaboration. From there data gathering begins, transformation is applied to create digestible and pivotable datasets and then visualizations are created using tableau. Visualizations can help stakeholders quickly grasp trends and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. Depending on the request, different methods are employed but simplification, automation and end-user autonomy is always top of mind.\nðŸ‘¾ Game Development # Creating video games in my spare time has been a fantastic journey, and publising a game on Steam was a dream come true. As a hobbyist, experimenting with different game mechanics and art styles, over many years has taught me a lot about a plethora of different software, just not game engines like Unity. This pursuit also enabled me to gain a great foundational understanding of C# as a language. I was able to successfully publish a game on Steam, which was a great experience. Even though it is a very simple clicker game, it was a great opportunity to peek behind the curatin and see what is required to formally launch a game on a platform like steam. The game is called PopIt! and you can check it out here. Currently I am working on a new game, which is a more arcade/action style space shooter.\nðŸŽ¶ Music # After over 20 years of playing guitar and immersing myself in music, Iâ€™ve had the incredible experience of publishing eight full-length albums on Spotify. My music journey began in dirty basement playing punk songs with friends, and it quickly evolved into a lifelong passion. Each album reflects different phases of my life, showcasing my growth as a musician and songwriter. I was able to write, record, mix and master all of the albums myself which was a great way to learn a ton about audio engineering. Over the years I have become quite proficient with recording DAWs and have a gained a great understanding of how to make decent sounding recordings.\nðŸ’¾ Computing \u0026amp; Technology # Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
