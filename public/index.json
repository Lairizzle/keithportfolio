My name is Keith. I am a Dad and a tech enthusiast who was raised by the internet. I am a Linux and FOSS (free and open source software) proponent who works professionally with things like SQL server, Datameer, Tableau, Python and much more. I like to be creative, whether that be with art and music or programming, game development and engineering. Learning has always been a top priority for me and expanding my knowledge is something I\u0026rsquo;ve always loved.\n\u0026#x1f468;\u0026zwj;\u0026#x1f4bc; Work # In my professional work, I focus on generating value from data by creating insights and reporting by leveraging tools like Tableau, Datameer, SQL, and Python. A typical project will start with requirements gathering and stakeholder collaboration. From there data gathering begins, transformation is applied to create digestible and pivotable datasets and then visualizations are created using Tableau. Visualizations can help stakeholders quickly grasp trends and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. Depending on the request, different methods are employed but simplification, automation and end-user autonomy is always top of mind.\nðŸ’¾ Computing \u0026amp; Technology # Computing and technology have been a part of my life since I was very young. I have my Poppy, his 133 Mhz machine and his 28.8k modem for immersing me in computers at an early age. I was hooked the first time I played Police Quest and put a password on a floppy disk.\nðŸ‘¾ Game Development # Creating video games in my spare time has been a fantastic journey, and publising a game on Steam was a dream come true. As a hobbyist, experimenting with different game mechanics and art styles, over many years has taught me a lot about a plethora of different software, just not game engines like Unity. This pursuit also enabled me to gain a great foundational understanding of C# as a language. I was able to successfully publish a game on Steam, which was a great experience. Even though it is a very simple clicker game, it was a great opportunity to peek behind the curatin and see what is required to formally launch a game on a platform like steam. The game is called PopIt! and you can check it out here. Currently I am working on a new game, which is a more arcade/action style space shooter.\nðŸŽ¶ Music # After over 20 years of playing guitar and immersing myself in music, Iâ€™ve had the incredible experience of writing, recording, mixing, mastering and publishing eight full-length albums on Spotify. My music journey began in dirty basement playing punk songs with friends, and it quickly evolved into a lifelong passion. Creaing all of the albums allowed me to learn a ton about audio engineering. Over the years I have become quite proficient with recording DAWs and have a gained a great understanding of how to make decent sounding recordings.\n\u0026#x1f468;\u0026zwj;\u0026#x1f393; Education \u0026amp; Expertise # I have listed a summary of my education, work and personal skills and expertise below. I have work professionally with data and reporting solutions daily, but I have a strong passion for tech in general and love learning new skills.\nEducation badge test College and Courses Sheridan College General Arts \u0026 Science Diploma Udemy Business Python C# Work Experience date - present Skills Data, Reporting \u0026 Analytics SQL/SQL Server Python Datameer Tableau Data Engineering/ETL Analytics Banking \u0026 Finance Collections \u0026 Credit Management Workforce Management \u0026 Productivity Incentive and Compensation Programs Personal and Commercial Banking Knowledge Technical Skills date - present Skills Game Development Unity Engine Game Design Shaders Programming Languages C# Python Bash Scripting SQL Various Other Languages Additional Skills Aesprite (Sprite Design) Video Editing Video Broadcasting Web Design/Development Graphic Design/Animation Networking/System Admin Terminal Enjoyer Arch btw...
