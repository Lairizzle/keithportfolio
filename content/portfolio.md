## :man_shrugging: Who am I?
Hi! My name is Keith. I am a Dad and a tech enthusiast who was raised by the internet. I am a Linux and FOSS (free and open source software) proponent who works professionally with things like SQL server, Datameer, Tableau, Python and much more. I like to think that I am fairly creative, whether that be with art and music or programming and game development. Learning has always been a top priority for me and expanding my knowledge and skill sets is something I've always loved doing.

## :man_office_worker: Work
In my professional work, I focus on generating value from data by creating insights and reporting by leveraging tools like Tableau, Datameer, SQL, and Python. A typical project will start with requirements gathering and stakeholder collaboration. From there data gathering begins and transformation is applied to create scale-able and easily pivot-able datasets. Once the data has been prepared, visualizations are created using Tableau. Visualizations can help stakeholders quickly grasp trends and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. Depending on the type of request, different methods can be employed but simplification, pipeline automation and end-user autonomy is always top of mind.

## ðŸ’¾ Computing & Technology
Computing and technology have been a part of my life since I was very young. I have my Poppy (grandfather) and his 133 Mhz machine, 28.8k modem and Netscape Navigator to thank for immersing me in computers at an early age. I will always remember the first time I typed a vulgar and childish instruction into the old Sierra DOS text prompt adventure game called Police Quest and it responded with something funny, I was blown away and I was hooked.

## ðŸ‘¾ Game Development
Creating video games in my spare time has been a fantastic journey, and actually publishing a game on Steam was a dream come true. As a hobbyist, experimenting with different game mechanics and art styles over many years has taught me a lot about a plethora of different software, not just game engines like Unity. This pursuit also enabled me to gain a great foundational understanding of C# as a language. I was able to successfully publish a game on Steam, which was a great experience. Even though it is a very simple clicker game, it was a great opportunity to peek behind the curtain and see what is required to formally launch a game on a platform like steam. The game is called PopIt! and you can check it out below. I am currently working on a new game, which is more of an arcade/action style space shooter.

## ðŸŽ¶ Music
With over 20 years of playing multiple instruments and immersing myself in music, Iâ€™ve had the incredible experience of writing, recording, mixing, mastering and publishing eight full-length albums on Spotify. My musical journey began in dirty basement playing punk songs with friends and it quickly evolved into a lifelong passion. Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of playing and writing with many talented artists over the years but writing with my good friend Douglas Richard Sinclair was always a great experience. I have included links to some of his work below. Working on all of the albums on Spotify allowed me to learn a ton about audio engineering. Over many years I have become quite proficient with different DAWs and have a gained a great understanding of how to make decent sounding recordings.
