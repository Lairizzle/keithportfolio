## PopIt! has launched on Steam!

I have put in motion everything that is needed to get PopIt! onto the Steam platform. It was a little more complicated than I originally anticipated, but now that I have done it once it should be easier in the future.

I have recently switched to a complete Linux setup and I still need to look at the best way to update the depots on Steamworks. It looks like the easiest option exists as a executable GUI but I doubt this will run on Linux. There is an alternative that is something to do with SteamCMD but I still need to look into it.

Steam seems to hold peopleâ€™s first releases for a little while but hopefully we can get PopIt! released on Steam for early September.

I want to continue to hone my C# and game development skills, so I will likely use this blog as a way to catalog my development and productivity.

Cheers,
Keith
